changes:
- rscadd: A bunch of ruins have been re-added to the pool. Even the bad ones. Technically
    they never left, they just never spawned properly (But still took up budget!)
- rscdel: Counter to this, a bunch of planetary ruins have been removed for being
    weird filler. Only ONE type can spawn naturally now, the other has been slightly
    updated but still left as deadcode for the time being.
- code_imp: Wallpaint now uses defines, and have been split into three different categories.
- rscadd: Holestation now can actually pull in debris from space and mine asteroids
    properly. Haha. Oops.
- rscadd: The lavaland syndicate base has been entirely repainted over. Literally.
    It should serve as an example on how to detail further syndicate non-shuttles.
